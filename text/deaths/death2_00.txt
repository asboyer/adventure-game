You tell yourself you don't have time to help this random dwarf fight off some ogre. You don't even know who you are, or why you are here. On top of that, you don't even think you can fight the ogre off on your own with no weapons. How dare the dwarf expect this of you?

You slowly back away from the dwarf, who is making his way away from you too, going to fetch his ax. He stops once he realizes you aren't going to help him. His face reddens with anger.

"You will regret this! Navigating this forest alone is dangerous, its crawling with creatures who prey on fear. You will be dead by sunrise." The dwarf disappears into the thick brush of the forest.

The ogres loud noises draw closer, and before you can find a place to hide, the massive creature is upon you.

"Hello there puny being!" a loud voice mocks. "Will you be my pre-battle snack?"

You make run last attempt to escape, but the ogre grabs you with his massive paw and dangles you above his jaws. Your last thoughts are regretting your refusal to help the dwarf...
