You lie and tell the dwarf you know where you are.

"Great," the dwarf responds. "I am always happy to greet young travelers seeking the knowledge that I guard within the the Enchanted Forest of The Cosmic Province." 

The dwarf looks around and turns back to you. "Allow me to take you to the library, where I can get you some food and help you recover from the long and treacherous journey you endured to arrive here."

You follow the dwarf through the woods until you arrive at a castle covered in moss. You cross a small bridge that takes you over the moat, and you arrive to the castle's entrance. The large wooden doors tower over both you and dwarf. The dwarf mumbles a few words you don't understand, and the ancient looking doors slowly creak open. 

You try to see what lies beyond the entrance, but the inside of the castle is dark. As the dwarf walks into the darkness, he turns to you. "Are you alright? Follow me, the information you seek lies within the these walls, and nowhere else."

You don't have the slightest idea what this information is, and you are starting to regret lying to the dwarf.
