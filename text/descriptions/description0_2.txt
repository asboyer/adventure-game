"Oh, so you're new here?", the dwarf says as he eyes you with suspicion. "It's uncommon to have travelers find this guarded sanctuary without intent of doing so. The last time someone found this place on accident, I was a young lad of 100 years old. Very rare indeed."

The dwarfs eyes gaze off into the distance, and for a second you feel uncomfortable. Did he really not believe you? 

Before you can say anything in response, the sound of falling trees ends the silence.

"Oh no", the dwarf says. "While you found my forest on accident, a nearby tribe of ogres constantly seek to destroy my sanctuary. This is the third attack this week."

You hear the roar of a giant creature, and the sound is getting closer.

The dwarf turns to you. "My ax is still being repaired. It will take an hour before I get it back from the local blacksmith. Can you fend off this ogre will I fetch my ax? It would be a huge help. If you defeat this beast, we will continue our discussion on why you are here, and how I may assist you with whatever you need. I always return favors."

The dwarf turns to leave, but stops in his tracks and turns back to you. "Oh, and I forgot to mention, welcome to the Enchanted Forest of The Cosmic Province."
